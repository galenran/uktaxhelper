      tax, or legal advice. Always review your position with a qualified professional and consult official HMRC

      Calculations are generated using HMRC 2025/26 rules for income tax, National Insurance, and personal allowances.
      The figures may differ from your payslip because of rounding, benefits-in-kind, student loan repayments, or other
      employer-specific deductions.
