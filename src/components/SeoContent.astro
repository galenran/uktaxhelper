  <h2 id="personal-allowance">What is the UK Personal Allowance for 2025/26?</h2>
  <p>
    The personal allowance remains at <strong>£12,570</strong> for the 2025/26 tax year. You pay no income tax on this band of earnings, unless your income is high enough to trigger the taper described below. For most employees, salary sacrifice pension contributions and charitable Gift Aid donations can extend how much of the allowance stays tax free.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep in mind that the personal allowance is applied before any tax bands, so it effectively pushes the basic rate threshold higher for those earning below £100,000.

  <h2 id="national-insurance">Understanding National Insurance Contributions</h2>
  <p>
    Employees pay Class 1 National Insurance at <strong>8%</strong> on earnings between £12,570 and £50,270. Any salary above £50,270 is charged at a much lower <strong>2%</strong> rate, which means the effective marginal rate drops once you pass the upper earnings limit.
  </p>
  <p>
    NICs are calculated on a weekly or monthly basis by payroll software, but the annualised view shown here closely matches the rounded totals you will see on your payslip. Unlike income tax, National Insurance does not benefit from the personal allowance taper.

  <h2 id="allowance-taper">How the £100k Personal Allowance Taper Works</h2>
  <p>
    When your adjusted net income exceeds <strong>£100,000</strong>, the personal allowance is withdrawn at a rate of £1 for every £2 earned. By the time your income reaches <strong>£125,140</strong>, the full £12,570 allowance is lost—effectively creating a <strong>60%</strong> marginal tax band between £100,000 and £125,140 when National Insurance is included.
  </p>
  <p>
    Planning opportunities include pension contributions, charitable giving, and bonus deferrals. Reducing adjusted net income beneath £100,000 can reinstate part or all of the allowance, delivering significant tax savings.
